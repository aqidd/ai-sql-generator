## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Design Principles
- Code readability over premature optimization
- Component-based architecture (max 300 lines per component)
- Single responsibility functions (max 20 lines)
- Type safety with TypeScript throughout

### Backend
- Express.js with TypeScript
- MySQL2 with connection pooling
- Gemini AI for natural language processing
- Structured error handling with specific codes

### Frontend
- Vue.js 3 (preferred over React)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide Icons for static icons
- Potlab Icons for animations (https://www.potlabicons.com/)

### Code Quality Standards
- Type hints mandatory
- No unnecessary comments or docstrings
- Keep TODO comments
- Merge comments with same date
- File headers track changes with dates
- Refactor unused code, never delete used functions
- Test for readability first, performance second

## üîí Security

- Connection credentials are never stored
- Unsafe operations are blocked by default
- Input validation and SQL injection prevention
- Environment-based configuration
